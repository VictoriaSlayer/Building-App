# Building-App
<p>Hi, today is June 24, 2022. I work as an engineer in building construction. And I decided to learn REACT. This is description for my first big app, which will be written using it. And I hope I will end it soon)</p>
<br>
<p>This app will be mobile-only. And the main goal of it is economy of building and management teams time, which want to get information quickly and have no desktop access.</p>
<p>For example:<br>
- how many square meters of plaster we have done;<br>
- how much material was spent on it; <br>
- amount of workers we have on that or other building at this moment; <br>
- comments from the customer are there at the moment on the 12th or 15th floor of the 3rd section of the 5th building.<br>
However it takes a lot of time, to find answers to these questions. And however big bosses don't like to wait too long.
</p>
<br>
<p>And idea of my app is on it. Bring all the data together, automate calculations and give it to owner. To save time.</p>

<p>Below is the design of the application I made, as I add functionality, I will add pictures or gifs for a more complete overview.</p>

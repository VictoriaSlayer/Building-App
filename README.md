# Building-App
<p>Hi, today is 24 jyne 2022. I work like engineer in building construction. And decided to learn REACT. This is description for my first big app, which will be written on it. And hope i will end it soon)</p>
<br>
<p>This app will be only mobile. And the main goal of it - is economy of time building and management team, which want quickly get information and has no desktop access.</p>
<p>For example:<br>
- how many square meter of plaster we have done;<br>
- how much material was spent on it; <br>
- amount of workers we have on that or other building at this moment; <br>
- comments from the customer are there at the moment on the 12th or 15th floor of the 3rd section of the 5th building.<br>
However it takes a lot of time, to found answers for this questions. And however big bosses don't like wait too long.
</p>
<br>
<p>And idea of my app is on it. Bring all the data together, automate calculations and give it to owner. To save time.</p>

<p>Below is the design of the application I made, as I add functionality, I will add pictures or gifs for a more complete overview.</p>
